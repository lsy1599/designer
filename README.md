# LibreCAD

[LibreCAD](http://www.librecad.org) is a 2D CAD drawing tool
based on the community edition of [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org).  
LibreCAD has been re-structured and ported to [Qt](http://qt-project.org) 4   
and works natively cross platform between OS X, Windows and Linux.  
The license is GPLv2, but please read the LICENSE file for additional information.

The master branch is used for the development of version 2.1.0,  
which will hopefully be released by the summer of 2016.  
- https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/milestones/2.1.0
- http://forum.librecad.org/GUI-update-td5712246.html

The 2.0 branch represents the latest stable build (2.0.9) plus bug fixes.
