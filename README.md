# LibreCAD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LibreCAD/LibreCAD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LibreCAD/LibreCAD) 

[LibreCAD](http://www.librecad.org) is a 2D CAD drawing tool
based on the community edition of [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org).  
LibreCAD uses the cross-platform framework [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/),
which means it works with most operating systems.  
The user interface is translated in over 30 languages.  http://translate.librecad.org/

The LibreCAD source code is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.

Please read the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for additional information.

The master branch represents the latest pre-release code,  
and now requires Qt 5.2.1 or newer.  
The 2.1 branch will be the last to support Qt4.  
The 2.0 branch will be the last to support the QCAD toolbar. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LibreCAD/LibreCAD.svg?branch=2.0)](https://travis-ci.org/LibreCAD/LibreCAD)
